Parents Louis and Jessica Huang both immigrated to the United States from Taiwan.&nbsp;Eddie’s father and mother’s family home dates back to Hunan and Shandong in mainland China.&nbsp;His father made a living running a group of seafood and steak restaurants, including Cattlemans Ranch Steakhouse and Atlantic Bay Seafood and Grill.</span></p><p><span>The celebrity chef was not an only child, he grew uptogether with two brothers – Emery and Evan Huang, who are several years younger than him.&nbsp;Both brothers are businessmen who invested in real estate but later evolved into tech startups when they founded Batu Capital.&nbsp;Their latest addition is responsible for funding companies in sectors like blockchain, cannabis, and crypto.&nbsp;The two also deal with Big Data.</span></p><p><span>One of Eddie’s brothers, Emery, became the winner of the Writers of the Future Grand Prize for science fiction writing.&nbsp;Eddie Huang also wrote about his brothers in his memoir, which was made into a television show.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Eddie Huang’s wife, girlfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>The famous restaurateur doesn’t seem to be doing it either in terms of the relationship as he is not married yet and doesn’t seem to be in a relationship at the moment.&nbsp;However, he became very close in 2013 when he officially got engaged to then-girlfriend Dena, who he planned to get married to the next year.&nbsp;Sadly it did not work.</span></p><p><span>Later, whispers started doing the rounds about a possible romantic relationship with director Julie Scott when Eddie Huang uploaded some of her photos to social media.&nbsp;However, neither party offered confirmation or refutation.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>The multi-talented celebrity has accumulated a decent amount of money from his numerous careers.&nbsp;His annual income has been set at $500,000 and his monthly income has been estimated at $41,000 by several reputable sources.&nbsp;His net worth is currently listed as $2 million with the potential to see some positive growth at the next review.&nbsp;He’s also the proud owner of a Scion iA, which ranges in value from $16,500 to $18,000.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGidlJm2pnnHrpinn12XtrB51qKdnmWSp7y1tMSrqmaekaK2rcWMoKCrpJantqa6w2alnqxdrLyzwMdmmKCdXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-office-superfan-season-6.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="When Will the Office Superfan Season 6 Be Available on Paramount Plus?">&larr;

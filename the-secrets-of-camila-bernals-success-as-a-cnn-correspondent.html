She grew up in California with her family, and had a passion for journalism and world events, which led her to enroll at Florida International University from where she graduated with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Mass Communication focused on Journalism.</p><p>While she was studying at University, she worked as a reporter for South Florida News Service, where she covered community news for The Sun Sentinel, The Miami Herald, and The Palm Beach Post.</p><p>She has a younger brother named Julian Bernal Mejia, while her mother‚Äôs name is Adriana Bernal Mejia; details about her father remain unknown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com///affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Camila-Bernal-2017.jpg><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Following her graduation, Bernal set out to kickstart her career in Journalism. Her first reporter role came in 2014, when she joined Local 2 News ‚Äì KMID-TV based in Midland, Texas. She worked for the company nearly two years before moving, and in late-2015 she began working as a Telemundo Austin Reporter at KEYE-TV in Austin, Texas. She stayed at the company for two years and two months before she moved on again, to become a reporter at KRON-TV in the San Francisco Bay Area, where she worked for six months.</p><p>By this time, she‚Äôd become quite widely known and respected in the field, and was offered a journalism role at CNN, <a rel=nofollow href=#>joining the network in 2018</a>, as a correspondent for CNN Newscource, becoming the first reporter to deliver live reports and digital content in both English and Spanish, for more than 1,000 CNN Newsource‚Äôs local news partners.</p><p>In the beginning of her involvement with CNN, she was based in the Washington D.C. bureau where she assisted in covering several major political events, including President Donald Trump‚Äôs impeachment trial, the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, the overall 2020 election, and confirmation hearings of several Supreme Court Justices as most notable examples.</p><p>She later moved to Minneapolis, where she covered the heated protests that followed the death of George Floyd, and also led the coverage of Derek Chauvin‚Äôs trial which followed the incident.</p><p>Today, Bernal is based in Los Angeles metropolitan area, and is a leading reporter on some of the most significant topics in the US. She‚Äôs covered the topic of <a rel=nofollow href=#>illegal immigration</a> across the Mexican border, and interviewed one of the so called ‚Äúsmugglers‚Äù who helped people to cross over. She also recently covered a story centered around Kineret Levin, who left behind her family, a job opportunity, and home and flew to Israel to volunteer as a medic.</p><p>Bernal is known for bringing a unique blend of professionalism and charisma to her reporting.

She was reporting from Coachella, CA, which is typically associated with festivals, but this time the focus was on the difficult working conditions the farmers faced, and ways in which they deal with temperatures of more than 110¬∞F, about 43C. The story focused attention on an often under-appreciated group of workers who help put food on the tables of millions.</p><h2><span id=Personal_life>Personal life</span></h2><p>Camila Bernal is married and her husband‚Äôs name is Eric.

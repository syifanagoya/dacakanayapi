That made Cooper upset. So much so, he decided not to&nbsp;proceed further with his date who had&nbsp;broken his cardinal rule - no talk of his famed mom in&nbsp;dates. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>More:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Proud Gay Guy Benson Boyfriend Is Officially His Partner; Their Go With The Flow Moment</a></p><h2>Dated Clifton Dassuncao</h2><p>Cohen <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">started</a>&nbsp;dating Harvard graduate Clifton&nbsp;Dassuncao in 2015. They met in March 2015 when Cohen was on the first night of his AC2 tour with CNN friend, Anderson Cooper, in Boston.</p><p>But&nbsp;their relationship only came into the spotlight after the media outlets spotted the duo thrice on Barry Diller’s $150 million&nbsp;yachts&nbsp;named Eos for two Caribbean getaways in 2016.</p><p>In the first gateway, they were <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">seen</a>&nbsp;laying on a beach. Cohen was reading novels wearing his ‘blue shades' before packing up to go back to their residence. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Andy and his then-boyfriend,&nbsp;Dussancao, enjoy&nbsp;sunbath while at a Caribbean beach in 2016</strong></p><p>Finally, in 2016, the New York native affirmed his relationship with his boyfriend.</p><p>He did so by mentioning&nbsp;Clifton&nbsp;Dassuncao as “Brazilian Andy Samberg” in his 2016 memoir,&nbsp;Superficial: More Adventures From the Andy Cohen Diaries. Also, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a>&nbsp;his partner gave him butterflies in an exclusive interview with the ETOnline.</p><h2>Why Did Andy Cohen & Clifton&nbsp;Dussancao Split?&nbsp;</h2><p>For Andy&nbsp;and Clifton, everything worked fine for some time, but things changed. After dating for some months, Andy and his environmental epidemiologist partner parted ways, with Andy hinting on differences they could not work out.</p><p>In March 2018, Cohen <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed </a>to Entertainment Tonight&nbsp;that he was single but didn't disclose why his relationship with Dussancao ended. He emphasized he didn't want a reality show drama in his love life, stating, <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>'I didn't sign up for a reality show.'</p><p>While Andy remained mum regarding his breakup, he revealed the crucial qualities he looked for in his ideal&nbsp;partner. He said,</p><p>Someone who’s very dependent, someone who has their own thing going on. Maybe someone who’s never seen The Real homemakers… I mean I could go on... So yes that’s what I’m looking for.</p><h2>Had Relationship With John Mayer?</h2><p>Andy's 'unlikely friendship' with American singer John Mayer led some to believe that the two had something going on between them. They visited the world together and were spotted many times together in public.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You May </strong><strong>Like:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>CNN Journalist Arwa Damon Boyfriend & Dating Status Revealed - Finally!</a></p><p>However, in the 2018 interview with CNN, Cohen&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">confirmed </a>they were not dating and were&nbsp;just soundly bonded friends who share a combined love for travel. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Has a Son</h2><p>The New York native is a father to Benjamin Allen Cohen. Named after his grandfather, Cohen's son was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">born</a>&nbsp;on February 4, 2019, through a&nbsp;surrogate mother from California.</p><p>Cohen had first <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a>&nbsp;his choice for&nbsp;surrogacy on&nbsp;December&nbsp;20, 2018, during the late-night talk show&nbsp;Watch What Happens Life.</p><p>Revealing that he would be a dad in about six weeks, he asserted he wanted to experience parenthood from many years before. He also&nbsp;added that family meant him everything, and having one of his own was something he craved in his heart for his entire life. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>" After many years of careful deliberation, a fair amount of prayers, and the benefit of science, if all goes according to plan, in about six weeks' time, I'm going to become a father thanks to a wonderful surrogate who is carrying my future."</p><p>During CNN’s special new year's eve show on 31st December 2018, Cohen <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">opened</a>&nbsp;about the gender of his child for the first time.&nbsp;While hosting the event alongside his best friend Anderson Cooper, he&nbsp;stated it was a boy and he couldn't wait to meet his son.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnkaOxunnCqJ%2Bepl2crrp5waiwn6qZmrulecOaq6Kml2O1tbnL</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-laura-vitale-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Laura Vitale Dating Now">&larr;
